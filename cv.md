## About myself
I'm a second year student at the IITU university. My speciality is information systems. Here I study the masters of project management along with the Java EE stack.

I am passionate about games of any kind, except shooters (always lose), like tetris, chess, and board games.

Now learning web development, because it seemed intresting to me. I have had experiense in several educational and pet projects.
